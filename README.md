# prayer-timings-finder
I didn't like most of the Islamic prayer times apps on Android, so I decided to improvise. I run this in Termux on my Android phone, but it will work in pretty much any terminal.

## Requirements
The code is written in Racket. In Termux, "pkg install racket" should do the trick.

## Configuration
The *options* associative list at the start holds all the configuration required. For more information on methods, look up the API's documentation here: https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api

## Extra notes
This is an old project, and is here for archival purposes.
